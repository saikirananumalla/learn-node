- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
Error
I was scheduled to run immediately
1ms have passed since I was scheduled

the I/O is done first on poll and then is the callback is picked since its the only operation,
in the callback. It starts callback execution, and it finds a timeout and puts it into timers
and it finds a setImmediate and is put into check, then it goes through and executes check queue and
then in the next iteration the timer element moves to pending_queue and that is executed

- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
no since check has priority over timers and
