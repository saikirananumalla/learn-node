- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
-foo
 baz
 foo
 baz
 2 : bar
 1 : bar
- the async call will be stalled and other calls are completed first, then after both foo and baz
complete these 'bar' are executed
- since timeout is 0 the timeouts are moved from timers to pending callbacks immediately, after the
sync calls complete then these pending callbacks state are executed
