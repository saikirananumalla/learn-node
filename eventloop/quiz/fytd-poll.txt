- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.
foo
done
Read Error

- first whole execution starts synchronously, then it finds a readFile async I/O call, the read happens on
a worker thread and the callback is pushed to pending callbacks
-meanwhile foo and done are logged.
- then the pending callback is executed and 'Read Error' is logged
